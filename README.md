## Concept

This framework and web app are designed to support a wide range of ciphers, formats, algorithms, and methods, referred to as ‘Bricks,’ while keeping them easily combinable. There are two main types of Bricks: Encoders and Viewers. Encoders process content by encoding or decoding it using specific methods and settings, while Viewers allow users to view, edit, and interact with content fed into or generated by Encoders in various formats.

Bricks can be arranged sequentially within a Pipe. When content is modified in a Viewer or Brick settings are adjusted, the changes propagate through the Pipe’s Bricks in sequence, in both directions.

Chain objects serve as containers for UTF-8 text or binary content exchanged between Bricks. They automatically handle the conversion between text-based and binary-based formats, enabling seamless integration when transitioning between different content types.
